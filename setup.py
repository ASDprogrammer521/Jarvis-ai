🤖 Jarvis AI — One-Time Setup & Installation

⚡ Installs the Python dependencies for THIS operating system only: the OS-specific
packages in requirements.txt carry `sys_platform` markers, ensuring macOS or Linux
users never pull Windows-only libraries (and vice-versa). It also automatically 
fetches the Playwright browsers required for seamless web automation.

📱 Android & Device Control:
  * Includes built-in Phone controlling support, allowing you to 
    control, automate, and manage mobile devices directly through the assistant!

✨ Two things deliberately excluded from automatic installation:
  * 🎙️ The optional local wake word ("Hey Jarvis") — one-click, opt-in, available 
    via ⚙ → WAKE WORD inside the application settings;
  * 👁️ Avatar rendering elements — the holographic head renders entirely in software 
    using PyQt6 and NumPy. No dedicated GPU, OpenGL, or extra packages required.
